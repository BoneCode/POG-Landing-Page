### "Papers on a Graph" is an interactive citation relationship explorer for Google Scholar which builds a centralized database of connections between academic papers as users explore.

This is a landing page that includes a button that allows a user to download an extension @graysondburke, @davidmason, @benyaffee and I made for our Senior Capstone project in our Senior Seminar Class.
